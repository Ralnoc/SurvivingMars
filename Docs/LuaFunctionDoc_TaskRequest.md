# Documentation for *TaskRequest*

## Overview

TaskRequests are Lua userdata objects that represent drone tasks. For example all resources that a drone can take are represented as supply task requests, while all buildings that require resources represent this need through demand task requests. A third type of a task request is the work request, where a drone is needed to perform a certain amount of work. The amount of work is specified in the request itself. While drones work with task requests, finding and assigning requests is done by DroneControl objects (Drone Hub, RCRover, etc.). The [TaskRequester](LuaFunctionDoc_TaskRequester.md.html) class provides facilities for task request management. All [Buildings](LuaFunctionDoc_Building.md.html) are task requesters. Resource amounts represented in requests are integers, generally scaled by const.ResourceScale (1000 at the time of writing).<br>
