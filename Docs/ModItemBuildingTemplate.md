Building Template
=================

This mod item type allows you to create new building variations based on existing building functionality, change some of their properties, and add them to the build menu of the game.

To provide custom game logic for the building, you need to implement it via a Code mod item. This code item should be a [Building](LuaFunctionDoc_Building.md.html) derived class, or possibly, derived from one of its children. The new class should then be assigned as a 'template_class' of the new building template. To provide custom art, you need to add an Entity mod item and import the art from Blender.
