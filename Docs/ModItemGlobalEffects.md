# Global Effects

Global effects are a way to define a desired behaviour in a certain mod, regardles of weather other parts of the mod such as a Commander Profile or the Mission Sponsor are selected. They are implemented using [Effects](ModItemEffects.md.html) and are useful for tweaking the game to suite different prefferences. Loading an existing save with mod using Global Effects won't have any effect on gameplay.
