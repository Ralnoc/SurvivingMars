## AddDemandRequest

Creates a [TaskRequest](LuaFunctionDoc_TaskRequest.md.html) with the given properties, and adds it to the task_requests table so it is visible to DroneControl objects. The building needs to re-connect to DroneControl objects if the state of the task_requests table changes. Alternatively, requests may be created before connecting, in the CreateTaskRequests callback for example. This function creates a demand request and automatically adds the flags designating it as such.<br>
<br>

bool **AddDemandRequest**(string resource, int amount[, int flags, int max_units])
string resource
: Resource id for this request. For resource request this is the string id of any resource defined in the Resources Lua table.

int amount
: The amount of resource this request represents.

int flags
: Optional. The flags of the request. The flags rfPostInQueue and rfDemand are automatically added to demand requests created with this function.

int max_units
: Optional. The max number of drones that can do this request simultaneously.

_returns_ TaskRequest result
: The created request.


## AddSupplyRequest

Creates a [TaskRequest](LuaFunctionDoc_TaskRequest.md.html) with the given properties, and adds it to the task_requests table so it is visible to DroneControl objects. The building needs to re-connect to DroneControl objects if the state of the task_requests table changes. Alternatively, requests may be created before connecting, in the CreateTaskRequests callback for example. This function creates a supply request and automatically adds the flags designating it as such.<br>
<br>

bool **AddSupplyRequest**(string resource, int amount[, int flags, int max_units])
string resource
: Resource id for this request. For resource request this is the string id of any resource defined in the Resources Lua table.

int amount
: The amount of resource this request represents.

int flags
: Optional. The flags of the request. The flags rfPostInQueue and rfSupply are automatically added to demand requests created with this function.

int max_units
: Optional. The max number of drones that can do this request simultaneously.

_returns_ TaskRequest result
: The created request.


## AddWorkRequest

Creates a [TaskRequest](LuaFunctionDoc_TaskRequest.md.html) with the given properties, and adds it to the task_requests table so it is visible to DroneControl objects. The building needs to re-connect to DroneControl objects if the state of the task_requests table changes. Alternatively, requests may be created before connecting, in the CreateTaskRequests callback for example. This function creates a work request and automatically adds the flags designating it as such.<br>
<br>

TaskRequest **AddWorkRequest**(string resource, int amount[, int flags, int max_units])
string resource
: Resource id for this request. For a work request this can be any string, such as "clean", "repair", etc.

int amount
: The amount of work the drone has to do to finish this request. Drones do about 5000 work per second, defined by DroneResourceUnits.repair.

int flags
: Optional. The flags of the request. The flags rfPostInQueue and rfWork are automatically added to work requests created with this function.

int max_units
: Optional. The max number of drones that can do this request simultaneously.

_returns_ TaskRequest result
: The created request.


## CreateResourceRequests

TaskRequester callback called in the object's game init thread. Useful for initializing the object's [TaskRequests](LuaFunctionDoc_TaskRequest.md.html).<br>
